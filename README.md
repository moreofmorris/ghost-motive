# Motive Ghost Theme

This is a clone of the excellent [Journal](https://github.com/tryghost/journal) theme for [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost). The aim is to use this as a basis for my own theme so it'll morph and change over time.

## Development
Make sure you have a [local instance of Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/) running on your machine and clone this so it's available in the `/content/themes/` folder of the Ghost project.
