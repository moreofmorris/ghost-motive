# Motive Ghost Theme

This is a clone of the excellent [Journal](https://github.com/tryghost/journal) theme for [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost). The aim is to use this as a basis for my own theme so it'll morph and change over time.

## Development
Styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need Node, Yarn and Gulp installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```
# Install
yarn

# Run build & watch for changes
$ yarn dev
```
